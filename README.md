ðŸ“– About
Across my applications, I needed a reliable way to send emails for different purposes â€” from handling contact form submissions on my portfolio site to sending password reset and email confirmation links for other projects like Poketask.
Instead of relying on third-party services, I built my own SMTP server to have full control over security, monitoring, and privacy.
